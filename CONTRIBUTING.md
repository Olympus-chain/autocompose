# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- docker
```

### 3. Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   cargo test

   # Run integration tests
   cargo test --test '*' --features integration

   # Test with Docker
   cargo run -- docker --dry-run

   # Test with Podman
   cargo run -- podman --dry-run
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:

   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

### 4. Coding Standards

**Rust Code Style:**
- Follow standard Rust conventions and idioms
- Use `cargo fmt` to format your code
- Use `cargo clippy` to check for common issues
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Write unit tests for new functionality

**Commit Messages:**
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add detailed description if needed

**Examples:**
```
feat(docker): add support for compose v3.9 features
fix(validation): handle empty environment variables correctly
docs(readme): update installation instructions for ARM64
```

   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what and why
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Test results or examples

3. **PR Guidelines:**
